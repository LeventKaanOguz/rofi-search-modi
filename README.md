# rofi-search-modi

## Introduction

This script utilizes classical usage of xdg-open to open webpages throughout desired browser. I have found this script on [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/4z2rww/comment/d6szls7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and want to use it with [JaKoolit's Hyprland Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots). I hope it gets integrated, but even it does note -or you simply are not using his dots- you can access it from this repository.

## Usage

Just run the script by 

```sh
./rofi-search.sh
```

and then a rofi instance will pop up, asking your input to search for.

## Further Inquiries 

I hope someone creates a modi, so we don't try to use this workaround. I couldn't find a way to make that work.
